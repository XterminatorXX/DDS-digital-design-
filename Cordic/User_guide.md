# üß≠ USER GUIDE ‚Äì CORDIC-Based Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS)

This project implements a **CORDIC-based DDS** system in Verilog targeting an **RFSoC device**. It outputs high-resolution sine and cosine signals using a **pipelined, quadrant-aware architecture** without any block memory or IP cores.

## üìÅ File Descriptions

- `cordic_algo_14bit.v`  
  ‚û§ Implements the **CORDIC rotation algorithm** with 14-bit input/output using a 13-stage pipelined datapath. Computes sine and cosine from signed angle input.

- `main_phase_14bit.v`  
  ‚û§ Top-level DDS module. Contains:
    - A **phase accumulator with FSM-based quadrant control**
    - A pipeline to manage CORDIC latency and correct output sign
    - Integration with `cordic_algo_14bit.v`

- `cordic_algo_14bit_tb.v`  
  ‚û§ Basic testbench for **standalone CORDIC** to verify correct sine/cosine output from fixed angle input.

- `main_phase_14bit_tb.v`  
  ‚û§ Testbench for the **complete DDS system**. Simulates real-time sine/cosine wave generation with configurable frequency.

## ‚úÖ How to Use

1. **Understand Input/Output Range:**
   - The CORDIC module uses a **14-bit signed angle input**, spanning:
     ```
     -8192 to +8191 ‚Üí represents -œÄ/2 to +œÄ/2
     ```
   - The output sine and cosine values are also **14-bit signed integers**, ranging approximately:
     ```
     sin_out, cos_out ‚àà [-6741, +6741]
     ```
   - CORDIC introduces a **gain** (`K`) due to vector rotations:
     - For **13 iterations**, the gain is approximately:
       ```
       K ‚âà 0.60725
       ```
     - To retrieve the actual sine/cosine values:
       ```
       sin_actual = (sin_out / 4096) * K
       cos_actual = (cos_out / 4096) * K
       ```
     - ‚ú≥Ô∏è Example:
       ```
       If sin_out = 6741
       sin_actual = (6741 / 4096) * 0.60725 ‚âà 0.99938 ‚âà 1.0
       ```

2. **Phase Accumulator + FSM Logic:**
   - The **FSM** divides the full `0 ‚Äì 2œÄ` range into 4 quadrants.
   - Internally maps each quadrant‚Äôs phase into the CORDIC's accepted `-œÄ/2 to +œÄ/2` input range.
   - The correct sign of sine and cosine is restored after a **14-cycle pipeline delay**, accounting for the CORDIC latency and FSM decisions.

3. **Set Frequency using `M`:**
   - `M` is a 14-bit signed **frequency control word**.
   - The output frequency `f_out` is computed as:
     ```
     f_out = (M / 2^N) * f_clk
     where:
       M     = frequency control word
       N     = phase accumulator width (here, N = 14)
       f_clk = system clock frequency (e.g., 200 MHz)
     ```
   - ‚ú≥Ô∏è Example:
     ```
     M = 200
     f_out = (200 / 16384) * 200e6 = 2.441 MHz
     ```
     When observed in simulation, the output is ‚âà 2.440 MHz, confirming the formula‚Äôs accuracy.

4. **Simulate:**
   - Use `main_phase_14bit_tb.v` to simulate the full DDS pipeline.
   - Open the waveform viewer (e.g., Vivado or ModelSim):
     - Set `sin_out` and `cos_out` **radix to "Signed Decimal"** for correct waveform visualization.
     - Use analog plotting to view sine and cosine waveforms smoothly.
   - Observe:
     - `sin_out`, `cos_out` waveform shapes
     - `phase_acc` cycling across 0 to 2œÄ
     - Quadrant transitions via the `state` signal
